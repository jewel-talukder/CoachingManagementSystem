# Quick Fix Summary

I understand your frustration! You want it simple like Angular's dist folder.

**The Problem:** Next.js dynamic routes need special handling for static export.

**The Solution:** I'm creating server component wrappers for all dynamic routes.

**After this fix:**
- Run `npm run build`
- Get `out/` folder (like Angular's dist)
- Copy to IIS - DONE!

Working on it now...
