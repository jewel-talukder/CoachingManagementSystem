# Quick Answer - Where are the files after publish?

## ✅ After `npm run build`:

**Output folder (like Angular's dist):**
```
coaching-frontend/out/
```

**Just copy this `out` folder to IIS - that's it!**

## ⚠️ Current Issue:

Next.js needs a small fix for dynamic routes. I'm fixing it now - will take 2 minutes.

## 📋 What You'll Get:

1. Run: `npm run build`
2. Get: `out/` folder (like Angular's `dist`)
3. Copy `out/` folder to IIS
4. Add `web.config` (I'll provide it)
5. Done!

**Working on the fix now...**
